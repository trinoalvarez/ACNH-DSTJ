# ACNH Data Sheet To JSON

Hey there! My name is Trino Alvarez and I absolutely adore the AC series of games, I've been playing them for a long time and since the release of ACNH, I've been inspired by the many projects out there using the data extracted from the game in order to aid and guide players around the world.

Having said that, I've created this repository to host a project which I've called **ACNH DSTJ (Data Sheet To JSON)** and using the **Data Spreadsheet for Animal Crossing New Horizons (https://tinyurl.com/acnh-sheet)** (amazing work, btw!), I've extracted each sheet into individual .XLSX files and subsequently into individual **JSON** files. Data is intact / untouched.

# Files and Directories

Inside this repository, you'll find all the JSON files in the root of the directory. Also, inside the XLS folder, you'll (obviously) find the .XLSX files which are the result of extracting every sheet in the **Data Spreadsheet for Animal Crossing New Horizons (https://tinyurl.com/acnh-sheet)** into individual .XLSX files.

# FYI

**Alexis LOURS (https://github.com/alexislours)** created an amazing tool called the **ACNHAPI**, which compiles the data into a very handy API, but the data doesn't include every single item in the game as far as I know (they've included what seems to be main categories like villagers, bugs, fish, music, fossils, art), that's why I've decided to create this project and although it's not an API, you can access the JSON files and host them / use them inside your own projects!

Alexis also created and maintains a **Google Sheets document with translations** for everything from items to villagers in the game, it's a very useful set of data which you could utilize in addition to their API or the JSON files I've created.
